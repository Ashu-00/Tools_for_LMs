# Tools_for_LMs
The aim of this repo is to make small but efficient tools for integration into language models called using api (or local).

## Tools to make
This is the list of tools that I currently have in mind and want to make.
- [ ] Search Tool
- [ ] Analyze Tool (Runs a python file)
- [ ] RAG ( for pdfs and smaller context retrieval)
- [ ] Long Context retrieval ( like GPT's bio)
- [ ] Image Generation (rephrasing prompt and calling image generation model)

## Other ideas 
- [ ] Music composer/ voice generation from queries
- [ ] Game like story mode in user-decides choices format.
